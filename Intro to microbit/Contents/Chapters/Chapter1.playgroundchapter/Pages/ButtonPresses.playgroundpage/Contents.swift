 Either side of the 5 x 5 LED display, the BBC micro:bit has two buttons, one is labelled **A**, the other **B**.
 
 We can use these buttons to carry out different functions.
 
 Letâ€™s use what we have learned in the previous two lessons to see how the buttons work.
 
 For this exercise you are going to display a text message when button **A** is pressed and display a shape (or *icon*) when button **B** is pressed.
 
 1. In the code below look for the box next to the first appearance of `button` and either type `A` or choose **A** from the completion bar.
 
 2. In the line below this, click in the box that says `Hello World` and write your own short message.
 
 4. Now look for the next appearance of the word `button` and either type `B` or choose **B** from the completion bar.
 
 5. In the line below this, click in the box for the `heart` icon. Choose a different shape if you wish from the completion bar.
 
 6. Run the code. Intially nothing happens other than clearing the screen so that it is blank. The micro:bit is waiting for a *button event* to happen.
 
 7. Tap button **A** to see the text scroll and button **B** to display your chosen icon.
 
 8. Return to your code and change your program to display the text when button **B** is pressed and an icon when button **A** is pressed.
 
 9. Run your code to see what happens.
